<h1>Overview</h1>
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate my skills on testing of a web site. 

<h1>Summary of Steps used to develop project</h1>
<p>This is a high level description of the steps I used to create and test this project.
<ol>
	<li> Reviewed requirements.
	<li> Ensured that Selenium webdriver (http://seleniumhq.org/download) and TestNG (http://testng.org/doc/download.html) were previously installed and ready for use.
	<li> Using Eclipse, created a new Maven project named SDETevaluationForHD. Maven was used so dependencies can be easily managed.
	<li> Configured pom.xml file to add required dependencies.
	<li> Converted project to TestNG to enable testing using TestNG. Right clicked on project in Eclipse, selected <b>TestNG</b>, 
	selected <b>Convert to TestNG</b>.
	<li> Downloaded ChromeDriver.exe and IEDriver.exe, placing them in Eclipse project's directory (same location as the pom.xml file).
	These are needed for enabling testing using the Chrome and InternetExplorer browsers. 
	<li> Created this Readme.html file and continuously made updates as needed.
	<li> Wrote java code in the following packages:
		<ul>
		<li>com.rosalietripp.demo.sdet.shoestore.pages
			<dl>
			<dt>ShoeReleasePage <dd>Class used for interacting with the web pages on behalf of the test classes.
			</dl>
		<li>com.rosalietripp.demo.sdet.shoestore.test
			<dl>
			<dt>CONFIG <dd>Contains some configuration constants used when testing
			<dt>MonthlyShoesNewlyReleaseTest <dd>Used for testing the 12 links (January, February, etc.)
			<dt>SubmitEmailAddrForReminders <dd>Used for testing the submit of email address
			</dl>
		<li>com.rosalietripp.demo.sdet.shoestore.utilities
			<dl>
			<dt>AssertMessage <dd>Contains the error messages used when testing
			<dt>CrossBrowserUtility <dd>Used to enable testing using various browsers
			<dt>CustomListener <dd>Used by TestNG to enable logging
			<dt>CustomReporter <dd>Used by TestNG to enable reporting
			<dt>WebElementUtility <dd>Misc methods for working with WebElements
			</dl>
		</ul>
	<li> To enable testing using TestNG, created testng.xml files:
		<dl>
			<dt>testng-allRun.xml <dd>For running all tests against the 3 main browsers in parallel.
			<dt>testng-browserChrome.xml <dd>For running all tests against Chrome browser only.
			<dt>testng-browserFirefox.xml <dd>For running all tests against Firefox browser only.
			<dt>testng-browserIE.xml <dd>For running all tests against Internet Explorer browser only.
			<dt>testng-linkJanuary.xml <dd>For running the January link test. Used when debugging.
			<dt>testng-linkNewReleases.xml <dd>For running the link  tests against single browser.
			<dt>testng-submitEmail.xml <dd>For running the submit email reminders tests against single browser.
		</dl>
</ol>
<h1>Running Tests</h1>
Tests may be run using Eclipse by right clicking on a <b>testng*.xml</b> file, selecting <b>Run As</b>, and then selecting <b>TestNG Suite</b>.
While tests are running, messages will be written to the console log. That is useful for seeing the progress. 
<p>When a test is completed, view results by opening the produced <b>index.html</b> file located in <b>test-output</b> folder. Notice the messages written for the failed cases.
